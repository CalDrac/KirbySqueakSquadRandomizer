# KirbySqueakSquadRandomizer

Randomizes items contained in chests, except for the strawberry shortcake, the goal of the game.

I have ideas to add randomizing options, but I don't have the knowledge in NDS rom structure to implement them.
If you know : 
- How to track which chest has been retrieved

Feel free to contact me : caldrac on discord
